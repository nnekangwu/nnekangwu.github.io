    <h2>Why are you applying to Prime?</h2>
     <p>I was informed that this was a great school to learn difficult tasks and my previous classes did not work out well for me. This seems a lot friendlier to new users.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <h2>Prime Academy will be an intense challenge. What challenges in your life have prepared for this?</h2>
      <p>When I was younger I was forced to go to a Nigerian high school at the last minute due to unexpected changes in plans. No experiences with this before, and dealing with new challenges like being asked to copy down A LOT more text as well as teachers that were sometimes absent and less available for help, I ended my final school year at the top of my class with a #1 spot in the math section. </p>

   <div> 
    <h2>Prime will introduce you to many challenging new technologies. What technology skills have you developed that might predict your ability to succeed at Prime? Please provide a few specific examples and share your reasoning. </h2>
      <p>I've taken a Computer Programming class in Computer Science at Bethel University and I've viewed the javascript textbook every now and then for additional help. I've also worked on coding my own website (albeit a rather long process) for a webcomic I'm creating.</p>

   <div>
    <h2>What makes you different from the other candidates who are applying to Prime? If accepted, how would this special characteristic add value for your cohort peers? </h2>
      <p>I'm very passionate about computers, not just taking it for the intention of using it in a more technologically advancing society, but also because i find coding and computers incredibly endearing.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <h2> Where would you ideally see yourself 3-months after Prime? In this scenario, how are you using the skills that you learned within the program?</h2>
      <p>I intend to work as an intern at a government facility my mother works at. I was told they could use someone who is able to handle more difficult, technological tasks.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <h2>Where do you hope to be after 3 years? What actions will you take to help you reach this milestone?</h2>
      <p>Admittedly not much planned in a few years but hopefully I get to land a decent job to hone my skills more.</p>
