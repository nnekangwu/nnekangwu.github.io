    <h4>Why are you applying to Prime?</h4>
     <p>I was informed that this was a great school to learn difficult tasks and my previous classes did not work out well for me. <br><br> This seems a lot friendlier to new users.</p>

   <div>
    <h4>Prime Academy will be an intense challenge. What challenges in your life have prepared for this?</h4>
      <p>When I was younger I was forced to go to a Nigerian high school at the last minute due to unexpected changes in plans. <br><br> No experiences with this before, and dealing with new challenges like being asked to copy down A LOT more text as well as teachers that were sometimes absent and less available for help, I ended my final school year at the top of my class with a #1 spot in the math section. </p>

   <div> 
    <h4>Prime will introduce you to many challenging new technologies. What technology skills have you developed that might predict your ability to succeed at Prime? Please provide a few specific examples and share your reasoning. </h4>
      <p>I've taken a Computer Programming class in Computer Science at Bethel University and I've viewed the javascript textbook every now and then for additional help. <br><br>I've also worked on coding my own website (albeit a rather long process) for a webcomic I'm creating.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <h4>What makes you different from the other candidates who are applying to Prime? If accepted, how would this special characteristic add value for your cohort peers? </h4>
      <p>I'm very passionate about computers, not just taking it for the intention of using it in a more technologically advancing society, but also because i find coding and computers incredibly endearing.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <h4> Where would you ideally see yourself 3-months after Prime? In this scenario, how are you using the skills that you learned within the program?</h4>
      <p>I intend to work as an intern at a government facility my mother works at.<br><br>I was told they could use someone who is able to handle more difficult, technological tasks.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <h4>Where do you hope to be after 3 years? What actions will you take to help you reach this milestone?</h4>
      <p>Admittedly not much planned in a few years but hopefully I get to land a decent job to hone my skills more.</p>
